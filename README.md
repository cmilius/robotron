# Getting started

Install python v3.11.1: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/  
**Make sure to check the option to add python to path!**
---
Once installed, set up a virtual environment using the following command:  
```python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment```  
This will create a target directory along with a .venv that contains the virtual environment. 
Then git clone the project into the newly created project folder.   
Make sure your IDE is connected to the new virtual environment -> this step will be specific to your IDE.
---  
Once you have cloned the repo and are in the virtual environment, use the command:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
This will install the package requirements for the project.
---
Lastly, to execute the program you just need to run the 'game.py' file.
